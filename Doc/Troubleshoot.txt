Issue: Some part of my world are not rendering fine or are missing (like missing or broken chunks).
Solution: Disable "Advanced OpenGL" in the video settings.

Issue: White or gray screen after reloading the shaders.
Solution: This is only a workaround, resize your Minecraft window.

Issue: Error message: java.lang.SecurityException: SHA1 digest error for XXX
Solution: Delete the META-INF directory from the minecraft.jar file.

Issue: pitch black or bright burn display upon loading another world
Solution: Workaround - exit and re-launch Minecraft.

Issue: Halp! I see no specular/envionment reflections, but I enabled the options in the base.fsh.
Solution: Check if you actually have a terrain_nh in your texture pack. Both fonctions require it.

Issue: I don't like your bloom so I de-activated it. Now everything is blurry!
Solution: the Bloom shader uses the two previous shaders named "BLUR_FP" and "BLUR_SP" to compute its effect. If you don't want the bloom, please also de-activate the two Blur shaders!
